# 100 days of Python

This is my journey of learning Python following the course found in Udemy, **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023**
by Angela Yu.

**Although I do not complete the course within 100 days, I will still come back to this project to hone and refactor my code in the near future.**

Some days are missed due to revision / refactoring previous days of code.

### Structure

This repo contains sub folders which have different projects that are completed on the given day during the course.

Stating off with basic syntax, vairables and math operations

Then logic statements, loops and dictionaries

Object Oriented Programming, along with inheritance

### Projects

Some cool projects I have built so far:

- Day 16, was an intro to OOP and I created a coffee machine project which will check if there are enough resources fo rthe selected coffee and correct price given during transaction

- Day 19, turtle race betting, prompt the user to choose a colour which then will start a turtle race (similar to horse racing)

- Day 20, a classic game of **SNAKE**, contains a scoreboard and infinite amount of tries.

- Day 22, another classic game of **PONG**, a two player game using buttons in the keyboard, "W" and "S" / "UP" and "DOWN" to play.
